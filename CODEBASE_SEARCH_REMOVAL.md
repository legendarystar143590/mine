# Codebase Search Tool Removal

## Summary
Successfully removed the `codebase_search` tool from the agent codebase and updated all references to use `search_in_all_files_content` instead.

## Changes Made

### 1. Tool Definition Removed
**File:** `a.py`  
**Lines Removed:** ~60 lines (lines 3468-3526)

Removed the entire `codebase_search` tool method that provided semantic search functionality:
- Tool method decorator
- Method signature and docstring
- Implementation using knowledge graph
- Error handling

### 2. System Prompt Updated
**File:** `a.py`  
**Lines Modified:** Lines 211, 220

#### TOOL CALLING Section:
```diff
- Use `codebase_search` for semantic code search (main exploration tool)
+ Use `search_in_all_files_content` for searching code across all files (main exploration tool)
```

#### CODE EXPLORATION STRATEGY Section:
```diff
-**Semantic search (`codebase_search`) is your MAIN exploration tool**
+**Text search (`search_in_all_files_content`) is your MAIN exploration tool**

-- Start with broad, high-level queries (e.g. "authentication flow" or "error-handling policy")
+- Start with specific search terms (e.g. class names, function names, error messages)
```

### 3. Available Tools List Updated
**File:** `a.py`  
**Line Modified:** Line 4624

```diff
  # Search and discovery
- "codebase_search",           # NEW: Semantic search (main exploration tool)
- "grep_search",               # NEW: Exact text/regex search
- "search_in_all_files_content",  # Keep for compatibility
+ "search_in_all_files_content",  # Main exploration tool
+ "grep_search",               # Exact text/regex search
```

## Verification Results

✅ **Total tools before:** 25  
✅ **Total tools after:** 24  
✅ **`codebase_search` removed:** Confirmed  
✅ **`search_in_all_files_content` exists:** Confirmed  
✅ **`grep_search` still exists:** Confirmed  
✅ **`file_search` still exists:** Confirmed  
✅ **No linter errors:** Confirmed

## Benefits

1. **Simpler Tool Set**
   - Removed redundant semantic search functionality
   - Clearer distinction between tool purposes

2. **Better Tool Usage**
   - `search_in_all_files_content` is now the main exploration tool
   - More predictable search behavior with exact text matching
   - No dependency on knowledge graph initialization

3. **Improved Guidance**
   - Updated system prompt provides clearer instructions
   - Focus on specific search terms rather than broad queries
   - Encourages more precise search strategies

4. **Code Quality**
   - Removed ~65 lines of code
   - Eliminated dead/redundant functionality
   - Simplified the tool manager

## Tool Alternatives

After this change, the agent has the following search tools:

| Tool | Purpose | Best For |
|------|---------|----------|
| `search_in_all_files_content` | Search across all Python files | Finding functions, classes, variables by name |
| `grep_search` | Fast regex search | Exact pattern matching with regex support |
| `search_in_specified_file_v2` | Search within a specific file | Locating code within a known file |
| `file_search` | Fuzzy file path search | Finding files by partial name/path |

## Migration Notes

Any agent workflows that previously relied on `codebase_search` should now:
1. Use `search_in_all_files_content` for general code exploration
2. Provide specific search terms (class names, function names, keywords)
3. Use `grep_search` for more complex regex patterns if needed

## Testing

The removal was verified with a temporary test script that confirmed:
- Tool was successfully removed from the class hierarchy
- Alternative tools are still available and functional
- No import or syntax errors introduced
- System prompt updates are consistent

## Status

✅ **COMPLETE** - All changes implemented and verified successfully.
