## üéØ Key Enhancements Implemented

### 1. **Meta-Planning Agent** (Lines 1100-1201)
**Purpose**: Strategic problem decomposition and execution planning before implementation

**Capabilities**:
- **Problem Analysis**: Identifies problem type, extracts requirements, constraints, edge cases, and affected components
- **Solution Decomposition**: Breaks complex problems into 3-5 manageable sub-tasks with dependencies
- **Approach Evaluation**: Compares 2-3 different approaches with pros/cons analysis
- **Verification Strategy**: Defines success criteria, test categories, checkpoints, and rollback plans

**When to Use**: 
- At the start of complex problems
- When multiple approaches are possible
- To reduce wasted effort by planning strategically

**Output Format**: Structured JSON plan with problem analysis, sub-tasks, approaches, and verification strategy

---

### 2. **Reflection Agent** (Lines 1203-1299)
**Purpose**: Self-critique and solution improvement before implementation

**Capabilities**:
- Reviews solutions across 6 dimensions:
  1. **Correctness**: Logical errors, requirement compliance, input/output handling
  2. **Completeness**: Missing requirements, edge cases, error handling
  3. **Robustness**: Invalid input handling, runtime errors, race conditions
  4. **Efficiency**: Time/space complexity optimization
  5. **Code Quality**: Readability, structure, naming, best practices
  6. **Backward Compatibility**: API changes, breaking changes, existing tests

**Process**:
1. Systematically analyze each dimension
2. Rate severity: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW
3. Provide specific examples and suggested fixes
4. Prioritize improvements by impact and effort

**When to Use**:
- After proposing solutions but before implementation
- To catch design flaws early
- To improve solution quality proactively

**Output Format**: Structured critique with issues, strengths, recommendations, and proceed/revision decisions

---

### 3. **Solution Validator** (Lines 1301-1436)
**Purpose**: Comprehensive solution validation against multiple quality dimensions

**Validation Categories** (Weighted Scoring):
1. **Functional Correctness (100%)**: Test outputs, edge cases, boundaries, exceptions, side effects, requirements
2. **Test Coverage (100%)**: Normal cases, edge cases, boundaries, exceptions, independence
3. **Code Quality (100%)**: Syntax, runtime errors, conventions, error handling, maintainability
4. **Performance (100%)**: Time complexity, space complexity, bottlenecks, resource usage
5. **Compatibility (100%)**: Backward compatibility, existing tests, Python version

**Validation Process**:
1. Requirements check (PASS/FAIL/PARTIAL per requirement)
2. Test execution analysis
3. Quality assessment with weighted scores
4. Edge case verification
5. Final decision with overall score

**Passing Criteria**:
- Overall score >= 85
- Functional correctness >= 90
- No CRITICAL blocking issues
- All categories >= 80
- All requirements PASS or PARTIAL

**When to Use**:
- After implementation and testing
- Before finalizing solutions
- To ensure production readiness

---

### 4. **Iterative Refinement Agent** (Lines 1438-1535)
**Purpose**: Solution improvement through feedback loops

**Refinement Priorities**:
1. Fix CRITICAL issues causing test failures
2. Fix HIGH severity issues affecting correctness
3. Address unhandled edge cases
4. Improve performance if below requirements
5. Enhance code quality and maintainability

**Improvement Techniques**:
- **Targeted Fixes**: Minimal surgical changes for specific issues
- **Refactoring**: Restructure to eliminate problem classes
- **Edge Case Handling**: Add explicit checks for edge cases
- **Algorithm Replacement**: Replace with fundamentally better approach
- **Defensive Programming**: Add input validation and error checking

**Refinement Process**:
1. Analyze feedback (categorize by type and severity)
2. Plan improvements (ordered list, conflict checking)
3. Implement changes (priority order, preserve working parts)
4. Verify improvements (ensure tests pass, no regressions)

**When to Use**:
- When test failures occur
- When validation score < 85
- When CRITICAL or HIGH issues found
- Maximum 3 iterations before reconsidering approach
