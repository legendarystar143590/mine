# StaticMethod vs ClassMethod Decorator Fix

## Issue
The code was failing with:
```
TypeError: Utils.delete_files_from_repo() missing 1 required positional argument: 'file_list'
```

**Error Location:**
- File: `/sandbox/agent.py`, line 1028, in `create_final_git_patch`
- Line: `cls.delete_files_from_repo(temp_files)`

## Root Cause

The `delete_files_from_repo` method had an incorrect decorator:

**Before (Lines 969-970):**
```python
@staticmethod
def delete_files_from_repo(cls, file_list: list[str]) -> str:
```

This is incorrect because:
1. `@staticmethod` methods should NOT have `cls` or `self` as parameters
2. The method was being called as `cls.delete_files_from_repo(temp_files)` (line 1028)
3. When called on a class with `@staticmethod`, Python doesn't pass `cls` automatically
4. So `temp_files` was being received as `cls`, and `file_list` was missing → TypeError

## Python Decorator Rules

### @staticmethod
- Does NOT receive class or instance as first parameter
- Called as: `ClassName.method(arg1, arg2)` or `instance.method(arg1, arg2)`
- Signature: `def method(arg1, arg2):`

### @classmethod
- DOES receive class as first parameter (`cls`)
- Called as: `ClassName.method(arg1)` or `instance.method(arg1)`
- Signature: `def method(cls, arg1):`
- Python automatically passes the class as `cls`

### Regular method (no decorator)
- DOES receive instance as first parameter (`self`)
- Called as: `instance.method(arg1)`
- Signature: `def method(self, arg1):`

## Solution

Changed the decorator from `@staticmethod` to `@classmethod`:

**After (Lines 969-970):**
```python
@classmethod
def delete_files_from_repo(cls, file_list: list[str]) -> str:
```

Now the method signature matches the decorator:
- `@classmethod` → expects `cls` as first parameter ✓
- When called as `cls.delete_files_from_repo(temp_files)`:
  - Python passes the class as `cls` automatically
  - `temp_files` is received as `file_list` ✓

## Why ClassMethod is Correct Here

The method should be `@classmethod` because:
1. It's called on the class: `cls.delete_files_from_repo(temp_files)`
2. It could potentially use class-level information (though currently it doesn't)
3. It's part of the `Utils` class utility methods

Alternatively, it could be changed to `@staticmethod` by:
1. Removing `cls` parameter: `def delete_files_from_repo(file_list: list[str])`
2. Changing the call to: `Utils.delete_files_from_repo(temp_files)`

But using `@classmethod` is more consistent with how it's currently called.

## Files Modified

- **`22/v4.py`**:
  - Line 969: Changed `@staticmethod` to `@classmethod`

## Verification

✅ **Syntax Validation:** Passed linter checks (no errors)
✅ **Signature Match:** Decorator now matches method signature
✅ **Call Site:** The call `cls.delete_files_from_repo(temp_files)` will now work correctly
✅ **Other Methods:** Verified all other `@staticmethod` decorators in the file are correct

## Other @staticmethod Methods Checked

All other uses of `@staticmethod` in v4.py are correct:
- `ToolUtils.run_subprocess` - no cls/self ✓
- `ToolUtils.validate_file_exists` - no cls/self ✓
- `ToolUtils.validate_syntax` - no cls/self ✓
- `ToolUtils.check_dependencies` - no cls/self ✓
- `ToolUtils.error_response` - no cls/self ✓
- `ToolUtils.success_response` - no cls/self ✓
- `Utils.ensure_git_initialize` - no cls/self ✓
- `Utils.set_env_for_agent` - no cls/self ✓
- `Utils.validate_json_schema` - no cls/self ✓
- `Utils.format_log` - no cls/self ✓
- `Utils.parse_test_results` - no cls/self ✓
- `Utils._parse_generic_output` - no cls/self ✓
- `ToolManager.Utils.maybe_truncate` - no cls/self ✓
- `ToolManager.Utils.is_path_in_directory` - no cls/self ✓

## Impact

This was a critical bug that prevented the `create_final_git_patch` method from executing. The fix:
- ✅ Allows the method to be called correctly
- ✅ Maintains the existing call signature
- ✅ No other code changes needed
- ✅ Consistent with Python decorator conventions

## Summary

Fixed a decorator mismatch: changed `@staticmethod` to `@classmethod` for `Utils.delete_files_from_repo` because the method signature includes `cls` as the first parameter. This resolves the TypeError when the method is called.
