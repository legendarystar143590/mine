# Start Over Tool Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a `start_over` tool that allows the BugFixSolver agent to revert all changes and start fresh with a new approach when the current approach is fundamentally flawed.

---

## Tool Implementation

### Tool: `StartOverTool`

**Location**: `ToolManager.StartOverTool` (Lines 3331-3453)

**Functionality**:
- Executes `git reset --hard` to revert ALL changes to initial state
- Logs the problem with old approach and new approach to try
- Clears temporary files list
- Provides clear guidance for next steps

**Input Parameters**:
1. `problem_with_old_approach` (required):
   - Detailed explanation of what was tried and key issues encountered
   - Must be specific about why the approach failed
   - Example: "Modified 6 files but each fix created 2 new P2P failures, indicating wrong root cause"

2. `new_approach_to_try` (required):
   - Clear description of the new approach
   - Must explain how it addresses failures of the old approach
   - Must explain why this approach will succeed

---

## When to Use `start_over`

### ‚úÖ USE When (ANY of these):

1. **Iteration Deadlock**
   - 5+ iterations of Step 4‚Üí5‚Üí6‚Üí7 with no meaningful progress
   - Each iteration takes longer but achieves less

2. **Cascading Failures**
   - One fix creates 3+ new bugs or test failures
   - The codebase becomes increasingly broken

3. **Regression Spiral**
   - Fixing one P2P failure consistently causes 2+ new P2P failures
   - Playing "whack-a-mole" with regressions

4. **Complexity Explosion**
   - Simple fix has grown to touch 5+ files
   - No clear end in sight
   - Solution becoming increasingly convoluted

5. **Wrong Root Cause**
   - After multiple attempts, evidence shows initial analysis was incorrect
   - Fixes address symptoms, not root cause
   - Fundamental misunderstanding of the problem

6. **Diminishing Returns**
   - Each iteration makes things worse, not better
   - More tests failing than before starting

### ‚ùå DO NOT USE When:

- Single syntax error or test failure (just fix it)
- First or second attempt at solution
- Minor tweaks needed to make solution work
- Haven't tried debugging thoroughly yet
- Only 1-2 iterations completed
- Making steady progress (even if slow)

---

## Decision Process

### Before Calling `start_over`:

1. **Use `sequential_thinking` to analyze**:
   ```
   - Why did the current approach fail?
   - What was fundamentally wrong?
   - What specific new approach would work?
   - Why will the new approach succeed where this one failed?
   - What lessons can be applied from this attempt?
   ```

2. **Document the failure**:
   - Specific issues encountered
   - Number of iterations attempted
   - Pattern of failures (cascading, spiral, etc.)
   - Root cause of approach failure

3. **Plan the new approach**:
   - Clear alternative strategy
   - How it differs from failed approach
   - Why it addresses the core issues
   - Expected outcome

### Example `start_over` Call:

```json
{
  "name": "start_over",
  "arguments": {
    "problem_with_old_approach": "Attempted to fix data validation by modifying the Validator class across 6 files. After 7 iterations, each fix broke 3-4 existing tests. The issue is that validation happens too late in the pipeline. Root cause analysis was incorrect - the problem is in data parsing, not validation.",
    "new_approach_to_try": "Will fix the data parsing in the Parser class before validation occurs. This addresses the root cause directly. Will only need to modify 2 files (parser.py and parser_utils.py) and existing validation logic remains untouched, preventing regressions."
  }
}
```

## Workflow Integration

### Updated System Prompt Sections:

1. **Guideline #9** (Lines 2343-2358):
   - Comprehensive guidance on start_over decision
   - Clear triggers and process
   - Post-start_over workflow

2. **Step 7.8** (Lines 2237-2276):
   - **Standard Iteration**: Normal retry loop
   - **ESCALATION Section**: When to start over
   - 6 specific triggers with examples
   - Step-by-step process for starting over
   - Real-world example scenarios

### Integration Points:

1. **After Step 7** (P2P Validation):
   - Agent evaluates iteration progress
   - Checks against start_over triggers
   - Decides: continue iterating OR start over

2. **After start_over**:
   - Returns to **Step 3** (may reuse reproduction if valid)
   - Proceeds to **Step 4** with new approach
   - Applies lessons learned from first attempt

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Cascading Failures
```
Problem Statement: "Function returns None instead of raising exception"

Attempt 1:
- Modified exception handling in 3 files
- Each fix broke 4 tests
- After 6 iterations, 12 new test failures
- DIAGNOSIS: Modifying exception handling everywhere breaks error propagation

START OVER:
- New approach: Fix only the specific function's return statement
- Touch 1 file, not 3
- Preserve existing exception handling
- RESULT: F2P passes, P2P passes
```

### Scenario 2: Wrong Root Cause
```
Problem Statement: "API endpoint returns 500 error"

Attempt 1:
- Assumed database query was wrong
- Modified query builder across 5 files
- After 8 iterations, still 500 error
- DIAGNOSIS: Error is in request validation, not database

START OVER:
- New approach: Fix request validator
- Only modify validator.py
- Database logic was correct all along
- RESULT: Fix in 1 iteration
```

### Scenario 3: Complexity Explosion
```
Problem Statement: "String formatting produces wrong output"

Attempt 1:
- Started with 1 file change
- Discovered edge cases, added 2 more files
- Found dependencies, modified 3 more files
- Now touching 6 files for string formatting
- DIAGNOSIS: Over-engineered, too complex

START OVER:
- New approach: Simple format string fix
- Touch 1 file with targeted change
- Don't try to handle all edge cases
- RESULT: Simple fix, no regressions
```

## Benefits

1. **Prevents Wasted Time**
   - Stops unproductive iteration cycles
   - Redirects effort to viable approach

2. **Preserves Codebase**
   - Reverts to clean state
   - Prevents accumulation of bad changes

3. **Encourages Learning**
   - Forces analysis of why approach failed
   - Documents lessons for new attempt

4. **Maintains Quality**
   - Prevents complex, fragile solutions
   - Encourages simple, targeted fixes

5. **Reduces Frustration**
   - Clear escape hatch from bad approaches
   - Explicit permission to restart

## Technical Details

### Git Reset Execution:
```python
result = subprocess.run(
    ["git", "reset", "--hard"],
    capture_output=True,
    text=True,
    timeout=30
)
```

### Success Response:
```
‚úÖ Codebase successfully reverted to initial state.

All changes have been discarded.
You can now start fresh with your new approach.

**Next Steps:**
1. Return to Step 3 to create a new reproduction script (if needed)
2. Proceed to Step 4 with your new approach
3. Implement the solution following the new strategy
```

### Error Handling:
- Captures git reset failures
- Logs detailed error messages
- Provides guidance for manual recovery
- Returns appropriate error codes

### State Management:
- Clears `tool_manager.temp_files` list
- Logs both old and new approaches
- Preserves context in auxiliary_data

---

## Monitoring & Logging

All start_over calls are logged with:
- Problem with old approach
- New approach to try
- Git reset output
- Success/failure status

**Log Format**:
```
============================================================
üîÑ START OVER - REVERTING ALL CHANGES
============================================================

Problem with old approach:
<detailed explanation>

New approach to try:
<new strategy>

============================================================
```

## Summary

The `start_over` tool provides a critical safety mechanism for the BugFixSolver agent:

- **Prevents** infinite iteration loops
- **Detects** fundamentally flawed approaches
- **Enables** fresh starts with learned lessons
- **Maintains** codebase integrity
- **Improves** overall success rate

It should be used **sparingly** but **decisively** when clear evidence indicates the current approach is untenable.

## Registration

Tool is automatically registered in `ToolManager._register_default_tools()` (Line 2910) and available to all BugFixSolver instances.
