# Summary of Changes to a.py

## Overview
Updated `a.py` to integrate the new system prompt from `prompt.md` and new tool definitions from `tool.json`.

## Major Changes

### 1. System Prompt (FIX_TASK_SYSTEM_PROMPT)
**Location:** Lines 191-360 (approximately)

**Changes Made:**
- Replaced the old verbose system prompt with a streamlined version
- Integrated modern guidelines from `prompt.md`:
  - Communication guidelines (markdown, clarity, skimmability)
  - Tool calling best practices (parallelization, semantic search priority)
  - Code exploration strategy (use `codebase_search` as main tool)
- Maintained fix-task specific workflow guidance:
  - Phase 1: Understand the Problem
  - Phase 2: Investigation
  - Phase 3: Solution Design
  - Phase 4: Implementation
  - Phase 5: Verification
- Added comprehensive code style guidelines
- Simplified common pitfalls section
- Retained tools_docs and format_prompt placeholders for dynamic content

### 2. New Tool Implementations
**Location:** After `finish()` method in FixTaskEnhancedToolManager class (around line 2730)

**New Tools Added:**

#### Core Search Tools
1. **`codebase_search(query, target_directories)`**
   - Semantic search using knowledge graph
   - Main exploration tool per prompt.md guidelines
   - Searches across codebase with natural language queries

2. **`grep_search(query, case_sensitive, include_pattern, exclude_pattern)`**
   - Exact text/regex search using grep
   - For precise symbol/string matching
   - Supports file type filtering

#### File Operations
3. **`read_file(target_file, should_read_entire_file, start_line, end_line)`**
   - Read files with line range support
   - Matches tool.json specification
   - Complements existing `get_file_content`

4. **`edit_file(target_file, instructions, code_edit)`**
   - Edit files with context markers (`# ... existing code ...`)
   - More intuitive than direct replacement
   - Supports both edits and new file creation

5. **`delete_file(target_file)`**
   - Delete files safely
   - Proper error handling

#### Discovery Tools
6. **`list_dir(relative_workspace_path)`**
   - List directory contents
   - Shows files and subdirectories with sizes
   - Quick exploration tool

7. **`file_search(query)`**
   - Fuzzy file path search
   - Find files when exact path unknown
   - Returns up to 10 matches

#### Stub Tools (for future implementation)
8. **`web_search(search_term)`**
   - Placeholder for web search functionality
   - Returns stub message

9. **`create_diagram(content)`**
   - Placeholder for Mermaid diagram creation
   - Returns stub message

10. **`edit_notebook(target_notebook, cell_idx, ...)`**
    - Placeholder for Jupyter notebook editing
    - Returns stub message

### 3. Updated Tool Registration
**Location:** `fix_task_solve_workflow()` function (around line 3960)

**Changes Made:**
- Updated `available_tools` list with organized categories:
  - Core file operations (read, write, edit, delete)
  - Search and discovery (semantic, exact, fuzzy, directory)
  - Code analysis (existing tools maintained)
  - Testing and execution (existing tools maintained)
  - Workflow control (existing tools maintained)
  - Additional tools (web search, diagrams, notebooks)
- Added inline comments to categorize tools
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing tools
- Total of 27+ tools now available

## Backward Compatibility

### Preserved Tools
The following existing tools are maintained for compatibility:
- `get_file_content` (alongside new `read_file`)
- `save_file`
- `apply_code_edit` (alongside new `edit_file`)
- `search_in_all_files_content` (alongside new `codebase_search`)
- `search_in_specified_file_v2` (alongside new `grep_search`)
- All knowledge graph tools (`get_file_summary`, `find_class_children`, etc.)
- All testing tools (`run_repo_tests`, `run_code`, `generate_test_function`)
- Workflow tools (`get_approval_for_solution`, `start_over`, `finish`)

### Tool Mapping
| Old Tool | New Equivalent | Status |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| `get_file_content` | `read_file` | Both available |
| `search_in_all_files_content` | `codebase_search` | Both available |
| `search_in_specified_file_v2` | `grep_search` | Both available |
| `apply_code_edit` | `edit_file` / `search_replace` | Original kept |

## Key Improvements

### 1. Semantic Search Priority
The new prompt emphasizes `codebase_search` as the MAIN exploration tool, with guidelines to:
- Start with broad, high-level queries
- Break multi-part questions into focused sub-queries
- Run multiple searches with different wording
- Keep searching until confident nothing remains

### 2. Better Tool Descriptions
All new tools include:
- Clear docstrings with purpose
- Detailed argument descriptions
- Output format specifications
- Error handling with specific error types

### 3. Simplified Workflow
The new prompt is more concise and actionable:
- Removed overly verbose sections
- Focused on practical problem-solving steps
- Emphasized autonomy and continuation
- Added code style guidelines

## Testing

### Syntax Verification
- ✅ Python AST parsing successful
- ✅ No syntax errors detected
- ✅ All imports valid
- ✅ Class structure intact

### Next Steps
To fully test the integration:
1. Run the agent with a sample bug fix task
2. Verify new tools are registered correctly
3. Test semantic search functionality
4. Confirm backward compatibility with existing workflows
